# About me

I'm Andrew, I am an urban planner and data science and GIS nerd, using R, QGIS, ESRI, and Python. I am excited about how we can put policy into action using technology and believe in building data infrastructure and governance strategies to better our communities.

Based in the Midwest on the edge of Lake Michigan.

# About this site

I plan to use this space to work out in public what I am thinking though at any given time.

My hope is that this will always be a work in progress site, or a digital garden. I plan to post ideas, concepts, and notes that I am working through that best reflects my understanding at any given time, but may change as I learn more. Refer to the [[changelog]] to see any latest changes to posts across the site. I may still have traditional posts that do not change over time, as these are helpful signposts reflecting our understanding at any given time allowing us to reflect on how our thinking changes.

Likely topics include:

- urbanisim and spatial related ideas
- tooling, programming, computers
- small research projects
- photography
- bikes
