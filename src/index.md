I'm Andrew, I am an urban planner and data science and GIS nerd, using R, QGIS, ESRI, and Python. I am excited about how we can put policy into action using technology and believe in building data infrastructure and governance strategies to better our communities. 

I plan to use this space to work out in public what I am thinking though at any given time. Thoughts about urbanisim, small research projects, and posts about my own learning explorations using coding and GIS tools.
Based in the Midwest on the edge of Lake Michigan.
